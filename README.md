## About

[WoeUSB](https://github.com/WoeUSB/WoeUSB) is a Microsoft WindowsÂ® USB installation media preparer for GNU+Linux, [WoeUSB Installer](https://github.com/joshjkk/woeusb-installer) is a script that installs all the dependencies needed to run WoeUSB on [Debian GNU/Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian).

This script was created because from my experience, it takes ages to install all the dependencies, and it would be a big help for myself and maybe others if it was all automated.

## Usage

### Give Execution Permissions

You won't be able to run the script if you don't give the script permissions to execute:

``` bash
chmod +x ./installer.sh
```

### **Default Installation**

*(required & optional dependencies, may cause errors)*

``` bash
sudo ./installer.sh
```

### **Required Dependencies Only**

Parameter: ```--required``` ```-r```

Example:

``` bash
sudo ./installer.sh -r
```
